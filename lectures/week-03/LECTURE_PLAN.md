## Goals
- Navigate Unity Editor panels: Hierarchy, Scene/Game, Inspector, Project, Console
- Understand GameObjects and Components (Transform, Renderers, Colliders, Rigidbody)
- Import Blender/FBX maze and extract materials
- Build and save a basic 3D scene, create Prefabs
- Configure basic physics for a resting sphere

## Timeline
1) Unity Project Setup (10 min)
- Create Unity 2022 LTS 3D project
- Create folders: Assets/Scenes, Assets/Models, Assets/Materials, Assets/Prefabs
- Save scene as Assets/Scenes/Week03_Intro.unity

2) Editor Tour (20 min)

3) GameObjects & Components (20 min)
- Transform, Mesh Filter/Renderer, Collider types, Rigidbody
- Demo: Plane (floor) + Cube with BoxCollider + Rigidbody -> Play

4) Importing Blender Assets (25 min)

- Scene and Project hygiene, naming conventions

6) Q&A + Assignment Overview (10 min)
- Review requirements; point to docs/weeks/week-03/assignment.html
